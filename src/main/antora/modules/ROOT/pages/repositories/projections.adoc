NOTE: It is important to note that <<projections.dtos,Class-based projections>> with JPQL is limited to *constructor expressions* in your JPQL expression, e.g. `SELECT new com.example.NamesOnly(u.firstname, u.lastname) from User u`.
(Note the usage of a FQDN for the DTO type!) This JPQL expression can be used in `@Query` annotations as well where you define any named queries.
And it's important to point out that class-based projections do not work with native queries AT ALL.
As a workaround you may use named queries with `ResultSetMapping` or the Hibernate-specific javadoc:{hibernatejavadocurl}org.hibernate.query.ResultListTransformer[]
